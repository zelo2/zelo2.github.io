I am a fourth-year Ph. D student from Business of School, Central South University. My research interests focus on Educational Data Mining (e.g., Cognitive Diagnosis, Exercise Recommendation, Learning Team Formation, etc.) and Tourism Recommender Systesms (e.g., POI Recommendaion, Trip Recommendation, Itinerary Modificaion/Edit, etc.)

Currently, I am a CSC-funded visting student co-supervised by [Prof. Zhu Sun](https://sites.google.com/view/zhusun/home) from Information Systems Technology and Design (ISTD), Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), and [Prof. Yunshan Ma](https://mysbupt.github.io) from School of Computing and Information Systems, Singapore Management University. I am very fourtunate to be supervised by [Prof. Hongyu Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=B1gqJ8UAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=sra) from School of Business, Central South University. Previously, I obtained the M.S degree from College of Information Science and Engineering, Hunan Normal University, under the supervision of [Prof. Hua Ma](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/author/37086381334) in 2022. I received the B.S. degree in integrated circuit design and integrated systems from Hangzhou Dianzi University, Hangzhou, China, in 2017.
